import LeanPoo.Proof.Invalidation

/-!
The temporal module's proof-reuse boundary. A cut revision is a LeanPoo
patch over subject/conclusion keys. LeanPoo's proof object carries the exact
dependency list for each conclusion obligation. This does not prove the Scheme
reverse index implementation or establish causal truth.

/--
The runtime-owned context in which an authority validates a receipt.

The source identity, declaration bundle, roots, and provided interface are
already bound by the receipt evidence model.  These fields close the remaining
enterprise state boundary: which authority generation, policy snapshot,
authorization snapshot, and revocation snapshot made that evidence acceptable.

Countermodel: binding the authority and policy snapshot still misses an
authorization or revocation change.  Therefore policy identity alone is not a
complete enterprise validation context.

predicate.  A graph must contain at least one receipt, and every receipt must
be accepted at the exact current authority context.

vacuously.  The nonempty condition in `receiptDagAdmitted` is therefore a
semantic requirement, not an implementation convenience.

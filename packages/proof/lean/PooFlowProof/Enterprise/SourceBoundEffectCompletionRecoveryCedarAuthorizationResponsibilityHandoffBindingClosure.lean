/-!
The Cedar subject bridge and the enterprise responsibility-handoff closure are
locally sound but own different projections.  RFC45-120-48 needs an explicit
cross-plane binding from the exact Cedar authorization subject and decision
evidence to the responsibility transfer asset and authority evidence, while
retaining successor acceptance as independent evidence.

/-!
The trusted projection from an effective capability contract to Cedar
arbitration risk.

The caller may state a preferred risk, but that value is deliberately ignored.
Only an explicitly admitted ordinary operation can select the
conformance-backed shadow mode; every privileged or unknown operation selects
strict lockstep.
